# Password Generator

## Description

- What was your motivation? 
My motivation for this project was to learn how to better use JavaScript and utilize it to allow a user to input information and be able to get a response back.

- Why did you build this project?
I built this project to allow a user to be able to input certain criteria needed for a password and receive a randomly generated password with the user's selected criteria.

- What problem does it solve?
The application solves the problem of users needing secure passwords without having to come up with one themselves.

- What did you learn?
I learned how to use JavaScript to prompt users for input and return values to them based on said input.


## Installation

I needed to clone the given starter code from my bootcamp instructors, edit the given code to make the application functional, and finally use GitHub Pages to deploy the application to the web.

## Usage and Screenshot

Click on the 'Generate Password' and follow the prompted questions that follow.  After answering all prompted questions you will be presented with your randomly generated password.
